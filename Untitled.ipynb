Flexibility: Conditional statements help make your code more flexible and dynamic. Depending on input, user choice, or data conditions, the program can take various actions.\n        # 4.

Each elif condition is checked only if all previous conditions (if and any preceding elif) are False.\n        # 3. If one of the elif conditions is True, the block of code under that elif is executed, and the rest of the elif and else statements are skipped.\n        # 4.
